# MedicalEdu Database Schema - Optimized Version

## Overview

This document describes the complete optimized database schema for the MedicalEdu platform, designed to support medical education with advanced course management, instructor-student bookings, payments, progress tracking, ratings, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Database Design Principles

- **GUID Primary Keys**: All entities use GUIDs for better distribution and security
- **Soft Deletes**: Entities use `deleted_at` timestamps for data preservation
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all critical operations with before/after JSON
- **UTC Timestamps**: All dates stored in UTC for consistency across time zones
- **Navigation Properties**: Full Entity Framework relationships defined
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Flexible pricing with currency tracking
- **Security First**: Account locking, session management, and comprehensive audit
